    Every year, Cal Poly Triathlon partners with United Way of SLO County to help support
    local nonprofits in our community. On race day, there will be an expo with food, games
    and contests for the participants, in addition to booths set up by our sponsors. Grab
    a friend, your best Valentine’s costume, and join us for a beautiful race day!"

    Eat as many donuts as you can and use your sugar-rush as fuel as you race to the top of Prefumo Canyon. <br/>
